        "Due to quantum effects on the molecular scale, they are of the unexpected orientation (similar charges attract)",
        "They are relatively strong in the \\(CH_4\\) molecules",

      "correct": "C",
      "hint": "Dipole-dipole attractions are electrostatic forces between atoms of polar molecules.",
      "detailed": "<ul><li>The first option is false, partially negative (\\(-\\delta\\)) atoms are attracted by partially positive (\\(+\\delta\\)) atoms.</li><li>The electronegativities of carbon and hydrogen are relatively close to each other, with hydrocarbons being notoriously non-polar, making the second option false.</li><li>The third option is true - larger electronegativity difference leads to large dipole moments, larger partial charges and larger electrostatic forces.</li><li>The fourth option is false because non-polar molecules do not have charged poles and electrostatic forces appear between two charges, not an charged particle and an uncharged one.</li></ul>",

      "detailed": "<ul><li>Induction forces appear when a polar molecule/ion induces a dipole in a non-polar molecule. Since the \\(Ne - Ne\\) pair contains no charged species, induction forces cannot appear.</li><li>Dispersion forces appear between any molecules, so the \\(CO_2 - CO_2\\) pair will have them.</li><li>Hydrogen bonds are formed only by molecules containing F, N and O, because: the negative pole has to be negative enough; the positive pole (the hydrogen atom) has to be positive enough, so bonded to a very electronegative atom.</li><li>Since \\(Br^-\\) is an ion, the \\(H_2O - Br^-\\) force is an ion-dipole force, not a dipole-dipole force.</li></ul>",

      "correct": "C",
      "hint": "The optic chiasm occurs way before the occipital lobe, almost immediately after the optic nerves leave the back of the eye.",
      "detailed": "The correct answer is option C. Rods, NOT cones are for dim vision. There are indeed red, blue, and green cones. The optic chiasm occurs not too far away from where the optic nerve exits the eye. The LENS gives an upside-down view of the outside world, not the cornea."

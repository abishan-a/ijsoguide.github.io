      "detailed": "The Pauli Exclusion Principle states that no two electrons can share the same set of quantum numbers - no more than two electrons may be found in an orbital.<br>The Aufbau Principle, also known as the diagonal rule, is the rule that helps us decide what subshel to fill first.<br>Once we're in a subshell, while filling it, Hund's rule helps us decide in what order to fill the orbitals.<br>The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is a principle from quantum mechanics related to the momentum and position of a quantum object; although orbitals and electrons are quantum objects, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is not dirrectly related to determining electron structures.",

But, because it has a +2 charge, 2 of its electrons should be removed, and you should remove the 2 outermost electrons. Those happen to be the two electrons of the 4s subshell, so the final configuration must be \\(1 \\text{s}^2 \\; 2 \\text{s}^2 \\; 2 \\text{p}^6 \\; 3 \\text{s}^2 \\; 3 \\text{p}^6\\).",

In other words, before pairing an electron with another electron, we must fill all the available orbitals.<br>Pauli's principle states that two electrons with the same spin (arrow pointing in the same direction) cannot occupy the same orbitals.<br>Looking at the given options, figure 2 is the only correct one, since figure 1 is in violation of Hund's rule, figure 3 is in violation of Pauli's principle and figure 4 is in violation of both.",

      "options": [
        "DNA conserves its original form in BOTH strands",
        "DNA has one old and one new strand",
        "The DNA strands are not unzipped during DNA replication; they are kept together.",

      "correct": "B",
      "hint": "This does not have anything to do with leading and lagging strands. Think about the prefix - semi.",
      "detailed": "The correct answer is B. The semi-conservative property of DNA means that it has one new AND one old strand of DNA."

        "New DNA strands are always built in the 3' --> 5' direction",
        "New nucleotides are added to the 5' end",

      "solutionImages": [],
      "correct": "D",
      "hint": "Helicase unzips the double helix.",
      "detailed": "The correct answer is option D. SSBs keep the two DNA strands from rejoining, NOT removing RNA primers. DNA polymerase I removed RNA primers and replaces them with DNA nucleotides. Topoisomerase relieves tension ahead of the replication fork. "

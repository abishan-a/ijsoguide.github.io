      "options": [
        "Requires energy input",
        "Requires ATP hydrolysis",
        "Requires no input of energy",

      "solutionImages": [],
      "correct": "C",
      "hint": "Energy input is characteristic of active transport.",
      "detailed": "The correct option is C. NO input of energy is characteristic of passive transport - it occurs naturally/spontaneously."

      "correct": "C",
      "hint": "Think of particles with high vs low kinetic energy.",
      "detailed": "The correct answer here is option C. Thermal motion of particles causes them to move apart and occupy as much space as possible."

      "question": "In diffusion across membranes, substances move:",

      "correct": "C",
      "hint": "Which is easier (takes less energy), moving WITH or AGAINST the concentration gradient?",
      "detailed": "The correct answer is option C. Particles always want to leave 'crowded' spaces and separate themselves."

      "hint": "Is the solute or the solvent that moves?",
      "detailed": "The correct answer is option B. Option A is incorrect because the solute never moves; the solvent moves to adjust the concentration of the solute. Osmosis is an entirely passive process."

      "correct": "C",
      "hint": "What does it mean for the solution to be hypertonic? Remember, tonicity is RELATIVE. The solution is hypertonic RELATIVE to the animal cell. What does that tell you about solutes?",
      "detailed": "The correct answer is C. Water moves to reduce the concentration of solute. It moves from high to low concentration of solute; therefore, the cell will lose water to the solution it was placed in."

        "It bursts",

        "It becomes flaccid and wilts",

      "solutionImages": [],
      "correct": "B",
      "hint": "What is mean for a solution to be hypotonic. Remember, it is hypotonic RELATIVE to the plant cell. Also, remember the difference between plant and animal cells (cell wall).",
      "detailed": "The correct answer is option B. Because the solution is hypotonic, the cell will 'absorb' water to reduce the concentration of solutes inside the cell. Remember that because of the cell wall (which keeps the cell rigid), the cell cannot burst."

        "It requires energy input",
        "Substances move down their concentration gradient",
        "It only transports nonpolar molecules",

      "solutionImages": [],
      "correct": "A",
      "hint": "Think of concentration gradient.",
      "detailed": "The correct answer is option B. Facilitated diffusion does not require energy input, it is still considered to be passive. However, it goes along with the preexisting concentration gradient and tries to move from areas of high to low concentration."

      "solutionImages": [],
      "correct": "A",
      "hint": "Carrier proteins are typically MORE specific than channel proteins.",
      "detailed": "The correct option is A. Channels open corridors - allow passage of molecules of a certain size and charge. Carriers bind a molecule, undergo a conformational change, cross the membrane with the molecule, and release it on the other side."

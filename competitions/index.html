            <h2>About the competitions</h2>
            <p>The IJSO Guide Challenge was created with the
            intention of promoting science learning
            through a competition, popularizing the
            IJSO, while also creating an IJSO-style
            competition, both for people who are not
            participating in the IJSO and for those who
            are participating and want to test themselves.
            <br>
             The contest is open and free of charge for all
            students throughout the world who meet
            IJSO age standards (born in 2010 or after).</p>
            <p>
                The IJSO Guide Problem of the week is a weekly online challenge for curious minds and problem solvers.
            Every week, we publish a fresh set of carefully crafted problems and invite participants from around the world to submit their solutions.
            Whether you enjoy physics, chemistry or biology, this contest is designed to stretch your thinking and reward persistence. Work at your own pace, test your ideas, and see how others approach the same problems.

      "detailed": "The Pauli Exclusion Principle states that no two electrons can share the same set of quantum numbers - no more than two electrons may be found in an orbital.<br>The Aufbau Principle, also known as the diagonal rule, is the rule that helps us decide what subshel to fill first.<br>Once we're in a subshell, while filling it, Hund's rule helps us decide in what order to fill the orbitals.<br>The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is a principle from quantum mechanics related to the momentum and position of a quantum object; although orbitals and electrons are quantum objects, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is not dirrectly related to determining electron structures.",

      "detailed": "Counting the number of electrons, we can see that there are 18, since the atom is a monovalent anion, its charge is -1, so the number of protons must be the number of electrons minus one. Therefore, there are 17 protons, which corresponds to chlorine.",

But, because it has a +2 charge, 2 of its electrons should be removed, and you should remove the 2 outermost electrons. Those happen to be the two electrons of the 4s subshell, so the final configuration must be \\(1s^22s^22p^63s^23p^6\\).",

      "correct": "B",
      "hint": "Aufbau's principle tells us how electrons are distributed among subshells. Since we're analyzing only one subshell, it isn't important to us in this problem. However, you need to check which of the given distributions respects Hund's rule and the Pauli exclusion principle.",
      "detailed": "Hund's rule states that, unless all orbitals in a subshell have at least one electron, no orbital may contain two electrons. In other words, before pairing an electron with another electron, we must fill all the available orbitals.<br>Pauli's principle states that two electrons with the same spin (arrow pointing in the same direction) cannot occupy the same orbitals.<br>Looking at the given options, figure 2 is the only correct one, since figure 1 is in violation of Hund's rule, figure 3 is in violation of Pauli's principle and figure 4 is in violation of both.",

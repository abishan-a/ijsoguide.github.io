      "detailed": "The number of protons is simply equal to the atomic number (so we have protons = Z). The mass number is the number of nucleons, so A = protons + neutrons, from which neutrons = A - protons = A - Z. Since we're talking about an atom, which is a neutrally charged particle, we have electrons = protons = Z.",

      "detailed": "The subatomic particle with a mass much lower than that of the others (around 1837 times smaller) is the electron. However, electrons are negatively charged, so they don't correspond to the provided description. Protons and neutrons have a high mass (on a subatomic scale), so they don't correspond to the description either. This means no subatomic particle corresponds to the description provided.",

        "A high fraction of most atoms' masses comes from uncharged particles",
        "Most of an atom's mass and volume is due to its nucleus",
        "A set of atomic number (Z) and mass number (A) values uniquely describes an atom (composition-wise)",

      "detailed": "Let's analyze each statement:<ul><li>Since the mass number is close to twice the atomic number for most elements, the number of neutrons is (more or less) equal to the number of protons. Since mass comes from protons and neutrons, a high fraction of the mass will be due to uncharged particles (neutrons)<li>Most of the mass is concentrated in the nucleus, because nucleons are much heavier than electrons; however, the nucleus is a quite small part of the nucleus and most of the atom's volumes comes from the electron cloud<li>We can show that no. of protons = no. of electrons = Z and no. of neutrons = A-Z, so, from a composition point of view, the atom is uniquely described by a  (Z; A) pair<li>Atoms do contain electrically charged protons and electrons. But, because the charge of protons is +e and that of electrons -e and because the number of protons is equal to the number of electrons, atoms are overall electrically neutral.</ul>",

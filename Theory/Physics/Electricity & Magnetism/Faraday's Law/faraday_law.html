    <p>Faraday's law of induction is the law that explains the correlation between the induced EMF and relevant parameters, which are the magnetic flux and time. The formula we get from this law is as follows:</p>
    <p>\[\epsilon = - \frac{\Delta \Phi}{\Delta t}\]</p>
    <p>Where:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>\(\epsilon\) - the induced EMF</li>
        <li>\(\Delta \Phi\) - change of the magnetic flux</li>
        <li>\(\Delta t\) - time interval during which the flux had changed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Other notable parameters</h2>
    <p>Parameters that are important are the rates of change, which describe how physical quantities change over time. An example you already know is velocity, which is the rate of change of distance, describing how distance changes over time.</p>
    <br><p>The general formula for any rate of change is the difference in the physical quantity observed over the time during which it had changed. Some rates of change that are important to mention are</p>
    <p>The rate of change of the strength of a magnetic field = \(\frac{\Delta B}{\Delta t}\)</p>
    <p>The rate of change of the surface area = \(\frac{\Delta A}{\Delta t}\)</p>
    <p>The rate of change of magnetic flux = \(\frac{\Delta \Phi}{\Delta t}\)</p>
    <br><p>As we can see, by Faraday’s law of induction, the induced EMF is equal to the negative rate of change of the magnetic flux.</p>
    <br><p>If we have a circuit of a constant area and we try to induce an EMF by having a magnetic field of variable strength, the formula for the change in flux is \(\Delta \Phi = A \times \Delta B\). If the magnetic field strength decreases, the change in flux would be negative, and if it increases, the change in flux would be positive.</p>
    <br><p>Another notable case is if we have a magnetic field of constant strength, we could try to induce an EMF by changing its surface area; in that case, the formula for the change in flux is \(\Delta \Phi = B \times \Delta A\). If the area decreases, the change in flux would be negative, and if it increases, the change in flux would be positive.</p>
    <br><p>The last case is if both the strength of the magnetic field and the area change, the change in flux is \(\Phi = B \times \Delta A + A \times \Delta B + \Delta A \times \Delta B\).</p>
    <p>The last term, \(\Delta A \times \Delta B\), is usually neglected if the changes are small.</p>
    <br><p>One important note is that the minus sign in the formula for Faraday’s law refers to the direction of the EMF and the direction of the current. The direction is further explained by <a href="../Lenz's Law/lenz_law.html" style="color:#9081dd">Lenz’s law</a>.</p>
    
    <button class="collapsible">Example 1: EMF generated</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>2 wires are connected by 2 parallel conductive and non-resistant rails. The distance between the rails, and the length of the wires is l. One of the wires is fixed at the ends of the rails, while the other moves along them with a constant velocity v with a direction parallel to the rails. Both of the wires are straight and perpendicular to the rails connecting their ends. A magnetic field of constant strength B is perpendicular to the plane containing the rails and wires. Calculate the EMF created by the moving wire, is it constant?</p>
      <br><p>Solution:</p>
      <p>By the information given, we know the rails and the wires make up a rectangle with a pair of sides whose lengths are equal to l. Let’s look at the wire’s movement during some interval of time t. In that time, the wire travelled the distance \(d=vt\) since the velocity is constant.</p>
      <br><p>Depending on if the wire is moving toward or away from the other, fixed wire, the area of the enclosed circuit will have either increased or decreased by the area \(A=vtl\). This is because the area the moving wire covered has a side equal to the length of the wire l and a side equal to the distance traveled \(vt\).</p>
      <br><p>Since the magnetic field is perpendicular, the strength of the magnetic field affecting the flux is equal to the strength of the whole magnetic field \(B\).</p>
      <br><p>Since the strength of the magnetic field is constant, using the next formula we can find the EMF induced, if time, t is present in the solution, the EMF is not constant, but if it cancels out, the EMF will be constant:</p>
      <p>\[\epsilon = - \frac {\Delta \Phi}{\Delta t} = - \frac{B \Delta A}{t}\]</p>
      <br><p>We found the increase in area is \(A = \pm vtl\), with t being the time interval for which this change in area is observed.</p>
      <p>\[ε = - \frac{B \times (\pm vlt) }{t}\]</p>
      <p>Since we are not required to find the direction of the EMF, we can ignore the signs</p>
      <p>\[ε=Blv\]</p>
      <p>Since time isn’t present in the solution, the induced EMF is consistent.</p>

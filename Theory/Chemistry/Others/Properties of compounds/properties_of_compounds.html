    <h2>Properties of Common Chemical Compounds</h2>
    <p>The following list </p>
    <ul>
      <li>\(NaCl\) (sodium chloride), commonly known as table salt, is a white crystalline solid. It is highly soluble in water, forming a solution that conducts electricity. It is hygroscopic; melting point = \(801^\circ C\)</li>
      <li>\(H_2O\) (water), an universal solvent with a polar molecule; used for drinking, cleaning etc; boiling point = \(100^\circ C\)</li>
      <li>\(NH_3\) (ammonia), colourless gas with a pungent smell; basic in solution; used for fertilisers, household cleaners and refrigerants; boiling point = \(-33^\circ C\)</li>
      <li>\(CaCO_3\) (calcium carbonate) ,white powder, insoluble in water; used for chalk, cement, toothpaste and construction. It decomposes intro \(CO_2\) and \(CaO\) at \(825^\circ C\)</li>
      <li>\(HCl\) (hydrochloric acid), strong acid, colourless; used for cleaning metals, pH control in pools and digesting food(stomach acid). It is gaseous (pure form)</li>
      <li>\(NaHCO_3\) (sodium bicarbonate), white solid, mildly basic; used as baking soda, fire extinguisher and deodorising. It decomposes into \(Na_2CO_3\), \(H_2O\) and \(CO_2\) upon heating.</li>
      <li>\(H_2SO_4\) (sulfuric acid), strong acid, oily and dense; used for car batteries, fertilisers and as a drain cleaner. It can be found in a mix with \(SO_3\), called oleum (fuming sulfuric acid)</li>
      <li>\(CO_2\) (carbon dioxide), colourless gas, dissolves in water; used for carbonated drinks, fire extinguishers, refrigeration (dry ice - solid)</li>
      <li>\(H_2O_2\) (hydrogen peroxide), strong oxidiser, unstable; used as a disinfectant, bleaching agent, in hair dye</li>
      <li>\(Ca(OH)_2\) (calcium hydroxide), white powder or solution, low solubility (precipitate); used as limewater for \(CO_2\) collecting and as a soil treatment</li>
      <li>\(NaOH\) (sodium hydroxide), strong base, soluble in water; used in soap making</li>
      <li>\(KNO_3\) (potassium nitrate), soluble salt, oxidising agent; used for gun powder and fireworks</li>
      <li>\(Al_2O_3\) (aluminum oxide), hard, white solid with a high melting point; product in aluminothermy</li>
      <li>\(SiO_2\) (silicon dioxide, silica), hard, crystalline solid, insoluble in water; used in glass making and semiconductors</li>
      <li>\(FeO(OH)\) (ferric oxohydroxide), red-ish/brown solid; rust</li>
      <li>\(CuSO_4\times 5H_2O\) (copper sulfate pentahydrate), blue crystals, soluble in water; used as fungicide </li>
      <li>\(Na_2CO_3\) (sodium carbonate), alkaline, soluble in water; used as a laundry detergent </li>
      <li>\(Na_2S_2O_3\) (sodium thiosulphate), white crystalline, soluble in water; used for chloride poisoning and in iodometric titrations</li>
      <li>\(BaSO_4\) (barium sulfate), white solid, highly insoluble; used for X-rays</li>
      <li>\(N_2O\) (nitrous oxide), gas ("laughing gas"); used in air bags and as an anesthetic</li>
      <li>\(MnO_2\) (manganese dioxide), black powder; used as a catalyst in the decomposition of substances such as \(H_2O_2\) or \(KClO_3\)</li>
      <li>\(H_3PO_4\) (phosphoric acid), weak acid, solid; commonly found in Coca Cola</li>
      <li>\(C_2H_5OH\) (ethanol), volatile, colorless liquid, flammable and polar solvent; it's used for alcoholic beverages and disinfectants</li>
      <li>\(CH_3COOH\) (acetid acid), colourless liquid with a pungent smell; weak acid; commonly known for its diluted form, vinegar.</li>
      <li>\(CH_4\) (methane), colourless, odourless gas; used for cooking/heating, fuel and electricity generation</li>
      <li>\(C_6H_{12}O_6\) (glucose), white crystalline solid, soluble in water; it's an energy source in food, part of photosynthesis and many other biochemical processes</li>
    </ul>

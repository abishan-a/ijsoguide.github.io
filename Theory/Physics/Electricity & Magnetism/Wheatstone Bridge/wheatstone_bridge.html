    <p>The Wheatstone bridge is a type of circuit usually used to measure resistance with high precision. The circuit is represented on the following scheme:</p>
    <img src="image1.png">

    <p>Using Kirchhoff’s law we can find that if the current flowing from point B to point D is equal to zero (if there is no current flowing between the two points) that the next formula is true for the resistances:</p>
    <p>\[\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \frac{R_4}{R_5}\]</p>
    <p>This also works in reverse order, if the resistors fulfill the formula above, no current will flow between points B and D, no matter the resistance or apparatus put in between them.</p>
    <br><p>This gives us the next statement:</p>
    <p>\[\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \frac{R_4}{R_5} ⟺ I_{BD} = 0\]</p>
    <p>This means that, when observing current or resistance of the whole circuit, we can eliminate  the current between points B and D because no current is flowing, and we can neglect the resistance between the 2 points because it won’t contribute to the total resistance of the circuit. Because of this, when redrawing the circuit for simplicity, we can redraw the part between the 2 points where current isn’t flowing (points B and D in our case) as a wire without any apparatus in between them, or we can just redraw the bridge without the wire between the 2 points, giving us the next, much simpler circuit:</p>

    <p>How is the Wheatstone bridge used to measure resistance?</p>
    <br><p>By putting a galvanometer that measures current between points B and D, we know that when the galvanometer measures a current of 0, the already mentioned formula is satisfied. Because of this, if we know the resistances of 3 of the resistors, we can easily find the resistance of the fourth one that we are trying to find.</p>

    <button class="collapsible">Example 1: Finding the resistance</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Find x if the bridge is balanced.</p>
        <img src="image3.png">
        <br><p>Solution:</p>
        <p>When the bridge is balanced, it means there is no current flowing through the galvanometer, so we get the next equation:</p>
        <p>\(\frac{R}{P}= \frac{S}{Q}\)</p>
        <p>\(R=\frac{SP}{Q}\)</p>
        <p>\(x + 400 = \frac{1000 \times 500}{800}\)</p>
        <p>\(x + 400 = 625\)</p>
        <p>\(x = 625 - 400\)</p>
        <p>\(x = 225 \, \Omega\)</p>

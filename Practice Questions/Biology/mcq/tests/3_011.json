      "question": "Which has less energy: \\(\\text{NAD}^+\\) or NADH?",
      "options": [
        "\\(\\text{NAD}^+\\)",
        "NADH",
        "Both equal",
        "Depends on the stage"
      ],
      "correct": "A",
      "hint": "Think about which molecule has electrons to donate.",
      "detailed": "\\(\\text{NAD}^+\\) is the oxidized form; it does not carry high-energy electrons. NADH is reduced and carries energy-rich electrons that can drive the electron transport chain. NADH is incorrect — it has more energy, not less. Both is wrong — redox states differ in energy. 'Depends on the stage' is misleading — relative energy is fixed."

        "Reduction",
        "Oxidation"
      ],
      "correct": "B",
      "hint": "ADP means adenosine diphosphate, ATP - adenosine triphosphate.",
      "detailed": "Making ATP involves adding a phosphate - phosphorylating - ADP. Hydrolysis is the opposite (breaking ATP down). Reduction involves electron gain, not phosphate transfer. Oxidation involves electron loss, unrelated here."

      "hint": "It happens before mitochondria are involved in the respiration cascade.",
      "detailed": "Glycolysis is cytosolic and does not require organelles. The mitochondrial matrix is for the Krebs cycle and pyruvate oxidation. The inner membrane is where ETC occurs. The intermembrane space is important for the proton gradient, not glycolysis."

      "hint": "Remember: “investment of 2, payoff of 4” for ATP, ethanol production only happens in anaerobic conditions.",
      "detailed": "2 pyruvate, 2 ATP, 2 NADH. During glycolysis, one glucose molecule (6C) is split into two pyruvate molecules (3C each). Along the way, 4 ATP are produced but 2 are consumed, giving a net gain of 2 ATP. Additionally, 2 \\(\\text{NAD}^+\\) are reduced to 2 NADH. <br> (A) 2 pyruvate, 4 ATP, 4 NADH → wrong because it reports gross ATP yield and doubles NADH count. <br>(C) 2 acetyl-CoA, 2 \\(\\ce{CO2}\\), 2 NADH → wrong because acetyl-CoA and \\(\\ce{CO2}\\) appear only after pyruvate oxidation in the mitochondria. <br> (D) 2 ethanol, 2 ATP, 2 \\(\\text{NAD}^+\\) → describes fermentation, not glycolysis itself."

Pyruvate loses \\(\\ce{CO2}\\) to form acetaldehyde — the intermediate that then continues to ethanol. <br> (D) Ethanol is final, but not the first conversion."

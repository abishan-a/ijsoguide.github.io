It is related to the empirical formula by a whole-number multiplier (n). For example, the empirical formula \\(\\ce{CH2O}\\) shows the simplest ratio of C:H:O as 1:2:1. If n = 6, then the molecular formula is \\(\\ce{C6H12O6}\\), meaning each molecule actually has 6 carbons, 12 hydrogens, and 6 oxygens."

        "detailed": "The first law of thermodynamics tells us that \\( \\Delta U = Q - W \\). In this case, \\( \\Delta U = (-400J) - 100J = 300J\\) (sign in front of 400J is negative because that heat is lost)."

        "hint": "Which kind of process is rapid compression?",
        "detailed": "During rapid processes, the gas does not have enough time to gain or lose heat from the surroundings, so these processes are adiabatic. Q=0, so the change of internal energy of this gas is 150J."

        "detailed": "In isothermal process the temperature of the gas does not change, so neither does its internal energy (\\( \\Delta U = 0 \\)) Changing \\( \\Delta U = 0 \\) in the formula, we get Q=350J (if the internal energy does not change, the gas has to get the energy to do the work from other source - get the heat from the surroundings)."

        "hint": "What is the change of the internal energy in the cycle?",
        "detailed": "For any complete thermodynamic cycle, the system returns to its initial state. Internal energy is a state function, meaning its change only depends on the initial and final states, so its change here is 0. Now, by applying the First law of TD, we get the net heat supplied is 500J."

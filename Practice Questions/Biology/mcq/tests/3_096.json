      "options": [
        "Bryophytes have fibrous roots while tracheophytes have a singular taproot",
        "Bryophytes are vascular, tracheophytes are nonvascular",
        "Bryophytes have a red pigment, tracheophytes have a green pigment",

      "solutionImages": [],
      "correct": "B",
      "hint": "This comparison has to do entirely with vascularization",
      "detailed": "The correct answer is option B, bryophytes (like moss, fern, etc) do not have a vascular system, so they make use of diffusion and osmosis. Tracheophytes, on the other hand, have a vascular system to supply tall plants (think of trees)."

        "Gymnosperms, bryophytes, and vascular plants",
        "Sporophytes, gametophytes, and vascular plants",

      "solutionImages": [],
      "correct": "D",
      "hint": "Sporophytes and gametophytes are plant generations, not types of vascular plants.",
      "detailed": "The correct answer here is option D. Vascular plants can be further divided into angiosperms (flowering and fruit-producing plants); gymnosperms (cone and needle producing plants); and seedless vascular plants."

        "Dicots roots have vascular system arranged in a ring; monocot roots have a vascular system that is scattered",

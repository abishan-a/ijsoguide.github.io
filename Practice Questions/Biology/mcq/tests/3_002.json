      "options": [
        "Hepatocytes are multinucleated due to cytokinesis failure",
        "Red blood cells are anucleated, to maximize space for hemoglobin",

      "solutionImages": [],
      "correct": "B",
      "hint": "There is no such thing as fission of cells",
      "detailed": "The correct answer is option B, red blood cells DO NOT have a nucleus to ensure that there is maximal space for hemoglobin. The more hemoglobin, the more oxygen it can carry. Option A is incorrect because hepatocytes are BINUCLEATED due to cytokinesis failure.  Option C is incorrect because skeletal muscle cells are multinucleated due to the fusion, not fission of cells. Option D is incorrect because sieve tube elements DO NOT have a nucleus, they rely on companion cells for metabolic needs."

      "correct": "C",
      "hint": "The stomata is the side of gas exchange",
      "detailed": "The correct answer is C. Chloroplasts have their own circular DNA, which is one reason why option D is wrong, because chloroplasts support the endosymbiotic theory. Option A is incorrect because thylakoid grana are stacks of thylakoids. The stomata is the site of the gas exchange, the stroma is the fluid-filled space within the chloroplast, where the Calvin cycle occurs."

(iii) is incorrect, mitochondria are ONLY found in aerobic cells. Option (iv), is correct, the cytoplasm resembles a colloidal solution."

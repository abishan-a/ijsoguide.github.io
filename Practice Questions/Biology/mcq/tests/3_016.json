      "correct": "B",
      "hint": "Inactivated vaccines involve dead pathogens.",
      "detailed": "The correct answer is B, because live attenuated vaccines contain living pathogens that have been weakened. They are not for those with an already weak immune system, but they provide longer-lasting immune responses because they can closely replicate the body's response to said infection."

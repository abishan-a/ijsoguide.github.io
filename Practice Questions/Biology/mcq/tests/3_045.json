      ],
      "questionImages": [],
      "solutionImages": [],
      "correct": "B",
      "hint": "Flatworms and roundworms have bilateral symmetry, meaning their bodies can be divided into two mirrored halves.",
      "detailed": "Sponges are unique, they do not have a defined body plan/symmetry. Sponges are considered asymmetrical. They have no true tissues or organs either."

      "options": [
        "Fast, directed movement",

      "correct": "B",
      "hint": "Imagine having arms and senses in all directions! What would you be able to do?",
      "detailed": "Radial symmetry is advantageous for detecting stimuli from all directions. For example, when feeding, one could reach out in all directions, increasing their chances of capturing food."

      "correct": "B",
      "hint": "Bilateral and radial are two very different body plans. Option C is qustionable.",
      "detailed": "Bilateral symmetry is closely associated with cephalization. Cephalization is the collection of sensory organs and nervous tissue at the front-most portion of the body. It makes sense because the 'control center' is at the front of the body."

      "detailed": "An organism can either be diploclastic or triploblastic. Diploblastic organisms have only the ectoderm and endoderm (no mesoderm). That means biploblastic aniamsl lack one layer."

      "solutionImages": [],
      "correct": "C",
      "hint": "Acoelomate is the same as having no cavity at all",
      "detailed": "Roundworms are pseudocoelomate, meaning they have a partially lined body cavity - not fully lined by mesoderm, unlike a true coelom."

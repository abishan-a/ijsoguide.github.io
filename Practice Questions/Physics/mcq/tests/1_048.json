      "question": "It is a very well-known science fun fact that the Eiffel Tower's height varies throughout the year. Its normal height at \\(0^\\circ C\\) is 330 meters. The highest temperature ever recorded in Paris is \\(42.6^\\circ C\\) (July 25, 2019) and the lowest one is \\(-23.9^\\circ C\\) (December 10, 1879, 8 years before the Eiffel Tower was built, but let's ignore that). If the linear thermal expansion coefficient of iron (consider the Eiffel Tower is pure iron) is \\(\\alpha = 1.2\\cdot 10^{-5) K^{-1}, find by how much the Eiffel Tower's height would change between these temperatures:\\)",

      "detailed": "The amplitude of the temperature range which we are studying is \\(\\Delta T = 42.6 - (-23.9) = 66.5^\\circ C = 66.5K\\). So, the variation of the height is \\(\\Delta H = H_0\\alpha\\Delta T = 0.2633m = 26.33cm\\).",

      "detailed": "The volume does decrease in the beginning for water, but this is an anomaly and is not usual. Also, it doesn't happen due to not uniform heating. The volume peaking at a certain value doesn't physically make sense, because the thing that made the volume increase up to that point, will keep making it increase. The density can't remain constant. The volume increases, but the mass has to stay the same - mass can't be created from nothing, or just disappear. So, the density will decrease, as objects are heated.",

      "hint": "Based on your current knowledge of physics, think which answer makes physical sense and is a full satisfying explanation",
      "detailed": "The real cause of thermal dilation is the increase of thermal (Brownian) motion. Microfractures wouldn't create a smooth volume increasing pattern, but a chaotic volume change, which would also involve decreases in volume. Extremely small quantities of substance do melt/sublimate/evaporate, but these processes happen at the surface, so the gas/liquid usually just leaves the system, but, again, the amounts are very small, negligible even on very small scales. The explanation about the atoms, doesn't actually provide a reason, it just says 'big things expans because smaller things also expand'. It still gives no reason as to why the atoms would expand (and they in fact do not expand)",

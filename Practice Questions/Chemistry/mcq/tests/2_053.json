        "correct": "A",
        "hint": "At what wavelength does \\(\\beta\\)-carotene ABSORB the most light?",
        "detailed": "Since the color of \\(\\beta\\)-carotene is orange, it means it reflects most of the orange light coming to it and absorbs the color that's opposite to orange. That corresponds to a cold color, around blue. Looking at the answer options and the visible spectrum given, the most suitable answer is 475nm."

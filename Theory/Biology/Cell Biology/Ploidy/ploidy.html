<h2>Ploidy</h2>
<p>Ploidy is simply the number of chromosomes that can be found in an individual cell.</p>
<h3>Symbols are used to represent the type of ploidy at hand:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>n represents the <strong>haploid</strong> number of chromosomes, the number of chromosomes in a <strong>single</strong> set</li>
    <li>The coefficient in front of n represents the number of sets of chromosomes, for example, 2n is double that of n</li>
</ul>

<h3>Key Types of Ploidy to know for IJSO:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Haploidy:</strong>half (n) of the somatic (non-sex) cell chromosome number.</li>
    <li><strong>Diploidy:</strong>individual with two sets of the basic, complete somatic (2n).</li>
    <li><strong>Polyploidy:</strong>individual with more than diploidy.</li>
    <li><strong>Aneuploidy:</strong>occurs when there is an error in cell division, resulting in more or less chromosomes. A missing chromosome is called a monosomy while an extra chromosome is called a trisomy. For example, Down Syndrome is caused by a trisomy on chromosome 21.</li>
</ul>

<br><p>Autosomal/somatic/non-sex cells have 2n or diploid and sex-cells have n or haploidy (half of autosomal)</p>

<h2>Gametogenesis</h2>
<p>Gametogenesis is the formation of gametes (egg and sperm) via meiosis (for more detail, visit cell cycle lessons). Sperm formation is called spermatogenesis while egg formation is called oogenesis. </p>
<h3>Spermatogenesis</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Occurs in the walls of the seminiferous tubules.</li>
    <li>The process begins with STEM cells, called <strong>spermatogonia</strong> which undergoes mitosis followed by meiosis to form 4 genetically varying sperm cells.</li>
    <li>Note that spermatogonia (stem cells) are present at birth, but inactive in state.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Oogenesis</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Occurs in the outermost layer of the ovaries.</li>
    <li>The process begins with STEM cells, called oogonium which undergoes mitosis and arrests the primary oocyte in prophase I (before birth).</li>
    <li>After puberty, meiosis continues.</li>
    <li>Note that by birth, all oogonium are already arrested in prophase I, till puberty.</li>
    <li>Oogenesis also exhibits the formation of polar bodies, which contain the adequate number of chromosomes but not enough cytoplasm and nutrients to develop into viable eggs.</li>
    <li>This occurs to ensure that the final ovum is rick in nutrients and cytoplasm!</li>
    <li>Note that by the end, there are 3 polar bodies (one formed during meiosis I, two formed during meiosis II) and only ONE viable ovum.</li>
</ul>

      "detailed": "Examining the gene, we can simulate the protein synthesis process and figure out which amino acids will be used - the primary structure. To figure out how the protein folds (secondary, tertiary and possibly quaternary structures), we need more advanced tools such as the AI-powered AlphaFold, which won its developers the 2024 Nobel Prize in chemistry.",

When these two groups interact, they form a special bond, which can be represented as -CONH-, known as a peptide bond, hence the name 'polypeptide' which is also used for proteins.",

      "correct": "B",
      "hint": "Instead of judging the answer options, try to remember yourself what ribosomes are, how the genetic code works and what tRNA and introns are, like no answer option was provided.",
      "detailed": "The first option is incorrect, because ribosomes also contain ribosomal RNA; the second option is true, and, in most cases, the codon to amino acid correspondence is the same in all species - strong indicator of a common ancestor; the third option is incorrect because tRNA is not just a codon, but the codon carries an amino acid; the last option is incorrect because introns aren't just remnants, they are useful when the mRNA molecule is slpiced because different splicing patterns lead to different proteins, even from the same gene.",

      ],
      "correct": "D",
      "hint": "RNA polymerase builds an RNA strand based on interactions between RNA nitrogenous bases and nitrogenous bases from the template strand",
      "detailed": "The RNA strand is complementary to the template (non-coding) strand. The coding strand is also complementary to the template strand. At first, we might think they are identical. However, the coding strand is a DNA strand, containing thymine, while the RNA strand contains uracil. So, all thymine in the coding strand is replaced with uracil. That means the synthesized RNA strand is identical to neither the coding, nor the template strand.",

      "correct": "C",
      "hint": "Make sure to pay attention to the details in the options. The mistakes in the wrong options are hidden in small details that might not appear to be the main point.",
      "detailed": "tRNA is represented by the anti-codons bound to aminoacids, used in the creation of the polypeptide chain, they are not obtained after transcription; the resulting RNA is called pre-mRNA which is then processed to form mRNA which is exported. Codons are sections of 3 nitrogenous bases encoding for an amino acid, but they are RNA sections, not DNA. rRNA is just part of the ribosomes, it isn't involved dirrectly in translation. The promoter is found before the gene, not the first section of the gene; the RNA-polymerase gets attached to the promoter and, after it, starts transcripting the gene.",

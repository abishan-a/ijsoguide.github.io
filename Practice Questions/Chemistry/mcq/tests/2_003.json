      "options": [
        "They are not the same chemical element",
        "Because they are isotopes, one of them will always be radioactive.",
        "They must always have a different number of neutrons",
        "Two isotopes of the same element can't naturally occur"
      ],
      "correct": "C",
      "hint": "One of the properties of isotopes is that they have the same number of protons.",
      "detailed": "In order for two atoms to be considered isotopes, they must have the same number of protons, but the amount of neutrons must be different. So, the correct answer is C), while A) is false. D) is false, because it is possible for more than one isotope of a element to exist naturally. B) is false because not all isotopes are radioactive, they are only radioactive if they are unstable (one element can have more stable isotopes, in fact most light elements do).",

      "correct": "A",
      "hint": "Isotopes must have the same number of protons",
      "detailed": "The answer is A) Carbon-13 and Nitrogen-13, because their chemical elements are different (Carbon and Nitrogen), so they have a different number of protons. C) Is true because Deuterium is hydrogen with 1 neutron and Tritium is hydrogen with 2 neutrons.",

      "detailed": "We can just apply the formula \\(U = k\\frac{q_1q_2}{r} = 900 kJ\\). Some might think that this energy is the energy of just one of the particles and you need to multiply it by two. However, the energy \\(U = k\\frac{q_1q_2}{r}\\) is the energy associated with the electrostatic interaction between the two particles and it is therefore the electrostatic potential energy of the entire system.",

      "hint": "A theorem in electrostatics tells us that the effect in a point due to multiple charges is identical to the superposition (sum) of the effect due to each individual charge.",
      "detailed": "Electric potential is a scalar quantity. To calculate the electric potential at one point, we simply have to sum up the potential due to each of the charges. One explanation for this is electric potential being defined as energy per charge. Since energy is an additive quantity (you add up energies to get the total energy), electric potential is also an additive quantity.",

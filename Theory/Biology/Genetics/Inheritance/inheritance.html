    <h2>Autosomal Inheritance</h2>
    <h3>Autosomal Dominant:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Affected offspring only need to have one affected parent (heterozygous individuals will still express the trait due to dominant masking)</li>
    <li>The condition appears in every generation when analyzing the pedigree.</li>
    <li>A dominant affected individual can have one or two dominant alleles (AA or Aa).</li>
</ul>
    <h3>Autosomal Recessive:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>In order for offspring to be affected, both of its parents must AT LEAST be carriers (heterozygous OR homozygous recessive).</li>
    <li>In other words, a recessive affected individual MUST have two recessive alleles (aa).</li>
    <li>The condition may not appear in every generation.</li>
    <li>Note that individuals who are carriers do not exhibit symptoms.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Consider the following Pedigree:</h2>

<img src="image1.png">
<ul>
    <li>Affected individuals are only observed in one generation, so it is unlikely that it is dominant. It must be recessive.</li>
    <li>Furthermore, BOTH a male and a female are affected, so it must be autosomal.</li> 
    <li>Therefore, the mode of inheritance for this pedigree is autosomal recessive.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sex-Linked Inheritance</h2>

<p>Traits must be carried by either the X or Y chromosome (sex chromosomes).</p>
<ul>
    <li>X-linked inheritance is the most common type of sex-linked inheritance, because the X chromosome contains about 5 times more genes than the Y chromosome.</li>
    <li>Recessive X-linked inheritance is always expressed in males (who have only one X) and in females ONLY if they inherit two copies of the mutated gene.</li>
    <li>Dominant X-linked inheritance will be expressed in males and in females who inherit EVEN ONE copy of the mutated gene.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following diagram effectively displays the outcomes of X-linked Recessive Inheritance:</p>

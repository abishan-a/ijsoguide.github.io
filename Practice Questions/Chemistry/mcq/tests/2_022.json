        "correct": "C",
        "hint": "Non-metal oxides tend to behave like acids in water.",
        "detailed": "Non-metals reacting with oxygen generally form oxides which are acidic in nature. For example, \\(\\ce{C + O2 -> CO2}\\), and \\(\\ce{CO2 + H2O -> H2CO3}\\). So the correct answer is an acidic oxide.",

        "hint": "In full combustion, carbon combines fully with oxygen.",
        "detailed": "In excess oxygen, carbon oxidizes fully to carbon dioxide: \\(\\ce{C + O2 -> CO2}\\). So the product is \\(\\ce{CO2}\\).",

        "correct": "A",
        "hint": "Only more reactive non-metal can displace a less reactive one from compounds.",
        "detailed": "Chlorine is more reactive than bromine, so \\(\\ce{Cl2}\\) can displace bromine from \\(\\ce{NaBr}\\): \\(\\ce{Cl2 + 2NaBr -> 2NaCl + Br2}\\). Hence option A is correct.",

        "correct": "C",
        "hint": "Non-metals do not donate electrons to hydrogen ions.",
        "detailed": "Non-metals are electron acceptors and cannot reduce \\(\\ce{H+}\\) ions to hydrogen gas. Thus they do not displace hydrogen in dilute acid and show no reaction. So option C is correct.",

        "solutionImages": [],
        "correct": "C",
        "hint": "Non-metals share electrons rather than transfer when bonding with hydrogen.",
        "detailed": "Non-metals form covalent hydrides by sharing electrons with hydrogen, e.g. \\(\\ce{NH3}\\) or \\(\\ce{HCl}\\). They do not form ionic hydrides in most normal cases. Option C is correct.",

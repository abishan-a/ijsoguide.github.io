      "question": "What is the process by which atmospheric nitrogen, \\(\\ce{N2}\\)(g), is converted to ammonium?",
      "options": [
        "Nitrification",
        "Ammonification",
        "Ammonitiation",
        "Nitrogen fixation"
      ],
      "questionImages": [],
      "solutionImages": [],
      "correct": "D",
      "hint": "Nitrification is going from ammonium to nitrite and possibly nitrate.",
      "detailed": "The correct answer is nitrogen fixation, turning nitrogen gas into a usable form for plants, which is usually ammonium, which can be more directly converted to nitrite and nitrate to be assimilated."

      "level": "easy",
      "question": "Which of the following accurately describes nitrogen assimilation?",
      "options": [
        "The conversion of ammonium to nitrogen gas to re-assimilate it into the atmosphere",
        "The integration of nitrogen into the amino acids and nucleic acids of the plant",
        "The use of nitrobacter and nitrosomonas to convert ammonium to nitrite and nitrate",
        "The integration of nitrogen into carbohydrates in the plant"
      ],
      "questionImages": [],
      "solutionImages": [],
      "correct": "B",
      "hint": "Carbohydrates are only made of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Nitrogen is not assimilated into carbohydrates.",
      "detailed": "The correct answer here is B. Nitrogen assimilation is the process by which nitrites and nitrates are readily taken up by the plant and integrated into the amino acids and nucleic acids that build plant structure and perform plant function. A is incorrect as it describes denitrification. C is incorrect as it describes nitrification. D is incorrect because nitrogen is not part of carbohydrates."

      "options": [
        "Assimilation - removal of nitrate (\\(\\ce{NO3-}\\)) or ammonium (\\(\\ce{NH4+}\\)) into amino acids and organic compounds by plants.",
        "Nitrogen fixation - conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into ammonium (\\(\\ce{NH4+}\\)).",
        "Ammonification - conversion of atmospheric nitrogen (\\(\\ce{N2}\\)) into ammonia (\\(\\ce{NH3}\\)).",

      "solutionImages": [],
      "correct": "B",
      "hint": "Assimilation is the INTEGRATION, not removal of nitrate into amino acids",
      "detailed": "The correct answer is B. Nitrogen fixation is indeed the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia"

      "options": [
        "Short-term plant benefit, at the expense of slower growing species",
        "Eutrophication, potentially leading to an algal bloom.",
        "Long-term increase in plant growth due to plentiful nutrient availability, also supporting microbial ecosystems.",

      "questionImages": [],
      "solutionImages": [],
      "correct": "C",
      "hint": "Fertilizer overuse is only beneficial in the short-term, before the plants and ecosystems realize there is excess.",
      "detailed": "The correct answer is C. Fertilizer overuse is short-term beneficial, not long-term. In the long term, it contributes to not-so-positive things like eutrophication and increased nitrous oxide emissions."

      "detailed": "The correct answer is option D. The lens can become thicker and thinner depending on the distance between the object and the individual."

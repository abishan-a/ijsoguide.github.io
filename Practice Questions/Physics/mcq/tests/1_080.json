          "They emit radiation continuously while orbiting",
          "They move in fixed orbits without radiating energy",

        "hint": "Bohr introduced the idea of stationary states.",

        "options": [
          "When it stays in the same orbit",
          "Only when it spirals into the nucleus",
          "When it jumps from a higher energy orbit to a lower one",

        "hint": "Photon emission happens during electron transitions.",
        "detailed": "When an electron moves from a higher energy level (n₂) to a lower one (n₁), a photon is emitted with energy equal to the difference between these orbits: \\(h\\nu = E_{n_2} - E_{n_1}\\)."

        "detailed": "The Bohr model only works accurately for hydrogen and hydrogen-like atoms with one electron. It fails to explain spectra of multi-electron atoms and doesn’t incorporate the wave nature of electrons or quantum mechanics fully."

      "question": "We can say about dipole-dipole forces:",
      "options": [
        "Due to quantum effects on the molecular scale, they are of the unexpected orientation (similar charges attract)",
        "They are relatively strong in the \\(CH_4\\) molecules",
        "In diatomic molecules, their strength increases as the electronegativity difference increases",
        "They appear between a polar molecule and a non-polar molecule."
      ],
      "correct": "C",
      "hint": "Dipole-dipole attractions are electrostatic forces between atoms of polar molecules.",
      "detailed": "The first option is false, partially negative (\\(-\\delta\\)) atoms are attracted by partially positive (\\(+\\delta\\)) atoms. The electronegativities of carbon and hydrogen are relatively close to each other, with hydrocarbons being notoriously non-polar, making the second option false. The third option is true - larger electronegativity difference leads to large dipole moments, larger partial charges and larger electrostatic forces. The fourth option is false because non-polar molecules do not have charged poles and electrostatic forces appear between two charges, not an charged particle and an uncharged one.",

      "detailed": "Dotted lines depict ion-dipole forces and solid lines depict hydrogen bonds. Only fluorine, oxyegn and nitrogen are electronegative enough to form hydrogen bonds.<br>The solid hydrogen bonds are the strongest intermolecular forces, so stronger than the ion-dipole interactions depicted by the dotted lines.<br>The hydrogen bonds between the water molecules form between a hydrogen atom of a molecule and the oxygen atom of another molecule, so the third option is correct.<br>The ion-dipole forces are formed between the negative chloride ion and the positive H pole of the water molecule.",

      "hint": "Think about why each force arises and if the species in the given pairs have the required properties to present these forces.",
      "detailed": "Induction forces appear when a polar molecule/ion induces a dipole in a non-polar molecule. Since the \\(Ne - Ne\\) pair contains no charged species, induction forces cannot appear.<br>Dispersion forces appear between any molecules, so the \\(CO_2 - CO_2\\) pair will have them.<br>Hydrogen bonds are formed only by molecules containing F, N and O, because: the negative pole has to be negative enough; the positive pole (the hydrogen atom) has to be positive enough, so bonded to a very electronegative atom.<br>Since \\(Br^-\\) is an ion, the \\(H_2O - Br^-\\) force is an ion-dipole force, not a dipole-dipole force.",

      "hint": "All intermolecular forces can eventually be compared to electrostatic forces. Think in which case the electrostatic forces are stronger.",
      "detailed": "Since electrostatic forces increase with the magnitude of the charges, ion-dipole forces (between a full ionic charge and a partial charge) are stronger than dipole-dipole forces (between two partial charges).<br>Although hydrogen bonds are the strongest intermolecular forces, they are still much weaker than covalent bonds, by a factor of around 30.<br>Although induction forces are dipole-dipole forces, one of the dipoles is induced in a non-polar molecule and very small in magnitude, making the force much weaker than a tipical dipole-dipole force between two polar molecules.<br>Not only are dispersion forces intermolecular forces, which are much weaker than covalent bonds), but they are towards the weaker side of the intermolecular forces.",

          "3.0",

        "correct": "D",
        "hint": "Magnification is the ratio of image height to object height, but its sign depends on whether the image is upright or inverted.",
        "detailed": "Magnification equals image height divided by object height, giving 36/12 = 3.0. However, the problem does not state whether the image is upright or inverted, so the sign of the magnification cannot be determined. Therefore, the correct choice is Insufficient Data."

        "detailed": "Using the thin lens equation: 1/20 + 1/b = 1/10. Solving gives b = 20 cm. The magnification is given by m = -b/a = -20/20 = -1.0."

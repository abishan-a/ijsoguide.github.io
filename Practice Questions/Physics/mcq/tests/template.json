      "detailed": "If the rate doesn’t change when the potassium hydroxide concentration changes, that can only mean the potassium hydroxide concentration doesn’t appear in the rate law. However, because it is a reactant, the term \\( [KOH]^n \\) should appear. Because, still, [KOH] doesn’t appear, we can only deduce that the partial reaction order is n = 0"

Dividing the two, \\(\\frac{v_1}{v_2} = (\\frac{c_1}{c_2})^n\\).

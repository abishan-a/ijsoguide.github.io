        "detailed": "Ionic bonds are basically just very polar bonds. A bond is very polar if: one of the elements is very electronegative (it pulls the electrons strongly towards itself) and one is very electropsotive (it has no problems with electrons being pulled from it). Of course the mosti ionic bond will be made of the most electronegative element - F - and the most electropositive element - Cs. So, the most ionic bond is Cs-F."

Methane isn't polar, because of its simetric structure, but HCl makes this answer option wrong.

Electrons are attracted by more electronegative elements, which become negatively charged - the negative pole of the bond - so the dipole moment points towards the more electronegative element, which is the negative pole. This makes options A and C wrong. D is correct, because electropsitivity is the inverse of electronegativity."

The electronegativty differences for the given bonds are: C-H - 0.3, O-O - 0, Be-Cl - 1.5, Cl-O - 0.5, H-Cl - 0.8. Generally, we consider the bond to be polar if this difference is 0.5 or more.

Let's consider one H atom fixed, and one spinning (it goes on a circle in 3D). When both H atoms are pointing downward, we say they're cis to each other, and when they're pointing in opposite directions we say they're trans to each other. In which of the cases os the net dipole moment of the hydrogen peroxide molecule larger?",
        "options": [
          "When its H atoms are cis, because the dipole moment vectors add up to the largest value possible",
          "When its H atoms are trans, because the dipole moment vectors are colinear so no component is canceled",
          "When its H atoms are cis, because are closer and the increase electrostatic repulsions increase the net dipole moment",

        "detailed": "When the two hydrogen atoms are trans, the dipole moments of the O-H bonds are colinear, but pointing in opposite directions, so they cancel out, making the net dipole moment zero.  When in cis position, the two dipole moments point in (roughly) the same direction and they add up to give a large value. Option C is wrong because of the explanation, electrostatic repulsion is irrelevant in finding polarity, while option D talks about individual interactions which don't matter because, overall, they cancel out."

        "question": "In physics, a dipole is a system consisting of two point-like charges +q and -q, at a distance d. The dipole moment is defined as \\( \\mu = q\\cdot d \\). Looking at hydrogen halides, the bond length increases from HF (92pm) to HI (161pm), so we would expect the dipole moment to increase as well. However, the dipole moment decreases quite drastically from HF (1.82D) to HI (0.44F). What is the explanation for this?",
        "options": [
          "As the bond length increases, it gets weaker. A high dipole moment would also weaken it, so the decrease in the dipole moment helps with satbilizing the hydride.",
          "The halogens' nuclei increases and, with more protons to atract electrons, more electrons are attracted towards the nucleus and less electrons are able to go towards the polarization of the bond, leading to a decrease in the charge q and subsequently to a decrease in the dipole moment.",
          "The hydrogen halides aren't at all similar to the simplified physical case presented, as they consist of multiple electrons and protons, and finding the dipole moment is more complicated and could lead to a function that decrases with d.",
          "As we go down from fluroine to iodine, electronegativity decreases. As the halogen is less electronegative, it attracts more charge and the charge q decreases. This decrease is sharper than the increase of d, leading to a decrease in the dipole moment."

        "detailed": "We'll analyze the options one by one. The first one just presents false facts. The highly polarized H-F bond doesn't destabilize HF which is actually a quite stable compound. And even if that were true, the dipole moment wouldn't decrease to make the molecule more stable, the compounds would just get more unstable and uncommon. The second option is false because q doesn't reffer to the total charge, but to the charge surplus/defficit of the atoms participating in the bond - the polarization of the bonding orbitals. The third options is partly true, as the atoms are not point-like charges, but in a rough approximation they can be considered identical to point-like charges found in place of the nuclei, with charge equal to the total charge of the atom. This works because most inner electrons are way closer to the nucleus than to the valence electrons and don't affect the polarization very much. The last option is true, as the decrease in electronegativity leads to a more uniform electron distribution."

For the \\( COCl_2 \\) molecule, the Cl-C-Cl angle is \\( 120^\\circ \\) and the net dipole moment of the two C-Cl bonds can be found to be 1.6D. Since the net dipole moment is 0.7D, towards O, the dipole moment of the C=O bond is 0.7 + 1.6 = 2.3D.

        "detailed": "Options A & B don’t count because they receive deoxygenated blood from the body. On the other hand, the ventricles pump oxygenated blood. Also, the left ventricle pumps blood to the body while the right ventricle pumps to the lungs. That is why the left ventricle is more muscular."

          "Veins have the lowest blood pressure",

        "solutionImages": [],
        "correct": "B",
        "hint": "Do capillaries really have the smallest cross-sectional area?",
        "detailed": "Option A is correct, veins have very low blood pressure compared to arteries, for example. Option C is correct because arteries have to be able to resist the strength of blood just being pumped by the heart. Option D is correct, because of their low blood pressure, valves ensure that backflow doesn’t occur. Option B is incorrect, because capillaries actually have the largest cross-sectional area, not the smallest. We add up all the capillaries in the body and their cross-sectional areas to come to this conclusion. Capillaries do have the slowest velocity because they have the LARGEST cross-sectional area - which falls in line with the continuity equation. Even if you didn’t know that piece of information, knowing that the other options are undoubtedly correct, that must be the incorrect answer. Sometimes reasoning is all you need!"

        "hint": "Remember that atria receive blood and ventricles pump blood back out. That should help with the order. Remember that the left ventricle is the most muscular compartment, and there is an important reason for that.",
        "detailed": "The vena cava brings deoxygenated blood back to the heart and the right atrium receives it. The right atrium pumps that blood unto the right ventricle which pumps it to the lungs. After returning from the lungs, it is received by the left atrium which pumps to the left ventricle. The left ventricle pumps blood back out the the body through the aorta. All of that corresponds to option C."

          "Open systems use vessels to completely contain blood, while closed systems release blood into body cavities.",
          "In closed systems, blood is pumped by the heart and stays within vessels, whereas in open systems, blood bathes organs directly in body cavities.",

BOTH make use of oxygen-carrying pigments making C incorrect. As mentioned during the lesson, annelids (which are invertebrates) also have closed circulatory systems — making D incorrect."

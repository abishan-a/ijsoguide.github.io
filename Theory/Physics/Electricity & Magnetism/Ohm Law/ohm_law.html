  <!-- Content -->
  <div class="container">
    <p>Even though his discoveries weren’t widely accepted at first, and called “a web a naked fantasy”, Georg Simon Ohm is now recognized as one of the main pillars for the understanding of electricity.</p>

    <h2>Intensity</h2>
    <p>- Definition: rate at which electrical charge flows past a specific point.</p>
    <p>\[ I = \frac{\Delta q}{\Delta t} \]</p>
    <p>We use the letter \( I \) to represent it, and it is measured in amperes (A) using an instrument called ammeter.</p>
  
    <h2>Voltage</h3>
    <p>- Definition: difference of electrical potential energy between two different points.</p>
    <br><p>In the content of a circuit, voltage is what makes current flow, meaning it makes the electrons move. The generators produce it.</p>
    <br><p>We use the letter \( V \) or \( \Delta V \) to represent it, and it is measured in volts (V) using an instrument called voltmeter.</p>
    <br><p>You can also find it as potential difference, electric pressure, or electric tension.</p>
  
    <h2>Resistance</h2>
    <p>- Definition: opposition to the flow of electric current.</p>
    <br><p>High resistance means less current flows for the same voltage, while low resistance means more current flows.</p>
    <br><p>We use the letter \( R \) to refer to it, and it’s measured in ohms (Ω) using an instrument called ohmmeter.</p>
  
    <h2>Ohm’s Law Formula</h2>
    <p>It states that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points, and inversely proportional to the resistance between them.</p>
    <p>\[ I = \frac{V}{R} \]</p>
    <ul>
      <li>\( I \): intensity [A]</li>
      <li>\( V \): voltage [V]</li>
      <li>\( R \): resistance [Ω]</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Tip: to understand better how a circuit works, it’s useful to visualize it like a flow of water, as shown in the figure below.</p>

    <p>It’s important to note that you can apply Ohm’s Law in the whole circuit, using the equivalent resistance, or in a specific resistance, battery, or other ohmic components.</p>

    <p><strong>A 20 Ω resistor has 10 V applied across it. What is the current?</strong></p>
    <p>\[ I = \frac{V}{R} = \frac{10}{20} = 0.5 \, \text{A} \]</p>

    <div class="content">
    <p><strong>A device operates at 12 V, but the maximum safe current is 0.2 A. What is the minimum resistance you must use to keep the current safe?</strong></p>
    <p>\[ R_{\text{min}} = \frac{V}{I_{\text{max}}} = \frac{12}{0.2} = 60 \, \Omega \]</p>

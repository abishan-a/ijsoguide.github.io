      "solutionImages": [],
      "correct": "D",
      "hint": "Think of the surface area to volume ratio",
      "detailed": "The correct answer is D. Cuboidal epithelia have a balanced surface area and volume, so they have enough volume to contain necessary structures (Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum) while having enough surface area for secretion of substances."

        "Thyroid",
        "Heart",
        "Lung",

      "correct": "A",
      "hint": "Think of parts of the body that deal with secreting substances.",
      "detailed": "The correct option is A, the thyroid secretes thyroid hormone. The other organs do not secrete substances as much."

      "question": "Which of the following epithelial cells is important for diffusion?",
      "options": [
        "Simple columnar epithelium",

      "correct": "D",
      "hint": "It has to be very thin, and plate-like for diffusion to occur easily.",
      "detailed": "The correct answer is option D, simple squamous epithelia are plate-like and specialized for diffusion. They would likely be found in blood vessels and lungs where gas exchange is important."

      "solutionImages": [],
      "correct": "D",
      "hint": "It cannot be simple squamous epithelium, as they are found in THIN areas with lots of diffusion. Focus on something that will be good at absorption.",
      "detailed": "Simple columnar epithelium are found in areas important in secretion and/or absorption, like the intestines."

        "Multiple layers of slanted cells",
        "One layer of cells without nuclei",
        "One layer of cells with nuclei at different heights",

        "Lymphocytes and eosinophils",
        "Macrophages and erythrocytes",
        "Macrophages and fibroblasts",

      "questionImages": [],
      "solutionImages": [],
      "correct": "C",
      "hint": "Eosinophils are specialized immune cells targeting parasites. They are also released during allergic reactions.",
      "detailed": "The two types of cells in connective tissue are macrophages and fibroblasts. Macrophages engulf foreign particles as a part of the immune system, and fibroblasts secrete fibre proteins."

        "question": "An indicator is usually a weak acid or base whose colour changes because its undissociated and dissociated forms have different colours. Which statement describes this behaviour correctly?",

          "Only its undissociated form exists in solution",
          "Both forms have the same colour",

        "detailed": "An indicator (weak acid/base) dissociates: \\(\\ce{HIn <=> H^+ + In^-}\\). The undissociated and dissociated forms have different colours, so colour depends on which form predominates."

        "detailed": "High \\([H^+]\\) shifts the equilibrium \\(\\ce{HIn <=> H^+ + In^-}\\) to the left → more undissociated \\(\\ce{HIn}\\) which has colour A. So colour A predominates."

          "Indicator whose transition range matches equivalence point pH",

        "hint": "Colour change needs to occur close to equivalence point.",
        "detailed": "For titration, the equivalence point’s pH should lie within (or near) the transition range of the indicator so the colour change happens around the correct moment."

        "correct": "B",
        "hint": "In basic solution, \\([\\ce{OH}^-]\\) is high so \\([\\ce{H}^+]\\) is low.",
        "detailed": "The equilibrium of the indicator is \\(\\ce{HIn <=> H+ + In^-}\\). In basic solution, \\([\\ce{H}^+]\\) is reduced because \\(\\ce{OH^-}\\) neutralizes it, so the equilibrium shifts to the right, producing more \\(\\ce{In^-}\\). Therefore, the dissociated form predominates and its color is observed."

<!-- Main content -->
<div class="container">
    <p>Certain genes or parts of genes can be turned on and off to achieve a very specific output.</p>
<ul>
    <li> <strong>Transcription</strong> factors can bind to specific gene sequences and either activate or repress transcription.</li>
    <li> The regions of DNA are bound by transcription factors are either called <strong>promoters, enhancers, or silencers.</strong></li>
    <li> Promoters are regions where RNA polymerase binds to initiate transcription.</li>
    <li> Enhancers are regions where the rate of transcription is increased.</li>
    <li> Silencers are able to slow down the rate of transcription.</li>
</ul>

<p>Increased transcription rates = more gene expression = more of the desired protein.</p>
<p>Everything discussed above with regards to gene regulation has to do with eukaryotic cells.</p>

<h2>Regulation of genes in prokaryotes:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Related prokaryotes are typically grouped together into <strong>operons</strong>, which are transcribed together under the control of one promoter.</li>
    <li>Positive regulation: <strong>Repressor</strong>proteins bind to operators, preventing RNA polymerase from initiating transcription.</li>
    <li>Negative regulation: <strong>Activator</strong> proteins bind to operators, enhancing RNA polymerase binding, increasing transcription.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Classic Olympiad Gene Regulation Example:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Lac operon in bacteria functions with 3 structural genes (lacZ, lacY, and lacA).</li>
    <li>When lactose is present, it binds to the lac repressor, <strong>preventing</strong> it from binding to the operator, allowing for transcription.</li>
    <li>When lactose is absent, there is nothing to block the repressor from binding to the operator, so transcription is stopped (no enzymes are produced to digest lactose).</li>
    <li>Note: Bacteria prefer glucose as opposed to lactose!</li>
</ul>
